Introduction
============

CodeIgniter Bootstrap kick starts the development process of the web development process by including Twitter Bootstrap into CodeIgniter. It also includes certain libraries such as AWS and Facebook in-case you are developing applications requiring those SDKs. So stop writing the same code over again and start working on your idea.

Requirements
============

You will need a proper web server that can run PHP 5.0 or higher. I will also suggest using a MySQL database, though you also encouraged to use other libraries that support a better database like MongoDB.

Included Libraries
==================

`$this->load->library('aws');`
`$this->aws->load('s3');`

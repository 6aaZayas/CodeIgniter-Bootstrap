## Introduction

CodeIgniter Bootstrap kick starts the development process of the web development process by including Twitter Bootstrap into CodeIgniter. It also includes certain libraries such as AWS and Facebook in-case you are developing applications requiring those SDKs. So stop writing the same code over again and start working on your idea.

CodeIgniter Bootstrap follows the path where it lazy loads libraries. Though the project footprint may be large, the memory footprint will still be extremely light. Try not to autoload libraries as it does not follow the CodeIgniter convention (though some libraries do make sense to autoload).

## Installation

Derived from CodeIgniter, read [CodeIgniter Installation](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/index.html) for how to install using this [zipball](https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap/zipball/master) instead. Read up on [CodeIgniter Tutorial](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/tutorial/index.html) on how to start a project.
